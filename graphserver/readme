*** Development ***

# start / stop the server. Logs will be in the current directory:
/var/lib/gems/1.8/bin/thin -C /var/www/liftium/graphserver/thin-dev.yml start

*** Production ***

# for the setup, I have followed the instructions here:
# http://articles.slicehost.com/2009/2/20/ubuntu-intrepid-thin-web-server-for-ruby

# the server is deployed in /var/www/liftium
$ cd /var/www/liftium; git pull

# the server is managed by thin. A symlink should exist from /etc/thin:
# this link is maintained by puppet.
$ sudo ln -s /var/www/liftium/graphserver/thin.yml /etc/thin/graphserver.yml

# to restart the server:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/thin restart

# log will be under /var/log:
$ tail -f /var/log/thin.4567.log
